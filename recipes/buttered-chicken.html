            <li>1 clove garlic</li>

        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heat oil in a small pot over medium heat. 
            Add chicken, onion, and ginger garlic paste. 
            Season with curry powder, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, bay leaves, cloves, red pepper flakes, black peppercorns, and coriander seeds. 
            Cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
            At this point, gravy will be runny; if you want to thicken, remove lid, and cook until liquid is reduced.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 2</li>
        </ul>
            <p>Puree the onion, ginger, and garlic with the water in a blender until it forms a smooth paste; set aside.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Step 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons in the skillet. Fry the onion paste in the hot oil until the moisture is mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle the garam masala and chili powder over the mixture; cook 1 minute more. Pour the tomato sauce into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook another 5 minutes. Return the chicken to the pan along with the half and half; bring to a boil. Add the butter, fenugreek leaves, and salt; reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered until the chicken pieces are no longer pink in the middle, 15 to 20 minutes.
